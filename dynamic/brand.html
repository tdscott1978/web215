            <h2>Brand Guide</h2>
         <br>
            <p>I realized in order for me to succeed, I need to do something that I love. So when trying to decide on a brand 
            &#40;actually 2 including Web250&#41;, I considered all the things that I love, like cooking, basketball, and video games.
           But ultimately I decided on music. It's the thing that I have discussed the most over the years with the widest range of people.
           Doing a website featuring my ten favorite albums of all time will allow me to add something else to my portfolio that helps tell
           my story. In the late 90's/ early 2000's I could tell a lot about a person just by looking through their CD collection. 
           My aim is to recreate that feeling in a digital format.  </p>
   
           <p>So the plan is 10 albums, 10 different pages. The idea is to make 10 pages that fit the themes of the album. Ideally, of course.
           This is a living document, so things can change as I go along. I may change the theme or the fonts. I may use different page 
           layouts. I'll give a description of the album and why it is important to me. I want each page to tell a different story. 
           </p>
           <p class="tagline">"Good music never goes bad"</p>
   
         <h2>Brand Theme</h2>
           <p>I chose bold, primary colors for the board. I wanted something that is complemetary and could fit in with a variety of album covers and
              colors. Each page will have a background image of the artist and the album cover on the inset. The album description will be in a color 
              block.
